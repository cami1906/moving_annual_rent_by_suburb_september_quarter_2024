# ETL and Analysis of Victorian Rental Property Data by Type of Dwelling

## 1. Data Integration
### 1.1 Combining Property Tables
Created a unified table combining data from all dwelling types except the 'all_properties' table. The integration process includes:
- Standardising date formats
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Ordering data chronologically

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.unioned_tables` AS
WITH source_data AS (
  SELECT 
    dwelling_type,
    region,
    area_suburb,
    PARSE_DATE('%b %Y', quarter) as quarter_date,
    `count` as listings,
    median as median_rent_price
  FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.1_bedroom_flat`
  UNION ALL
  -- Similar SELECT statements for other dwelling types
  -- ...
)
SELECT
  dwelling_type,
  region,
  area_suburb,
  quarter_date,
  listings,
  median_rent_price
FROM source_data
ORDER BY quarter_date;
```

## 2. Data Quality Assessment
### 2.1 Duplicate Detection
Verified data integrity by checking for duplicate entries:
```sql
SELECT 
  dwelling_type, 
  region,
  area_suburb,
  quarter_date,
  count,
  median,
  COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.unioned_tables`
GROUP BY dwelling_type, region, area_suburb, quarter_date, count, median
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
Result: No duplicate records found.

### 2.2 Missing Value Analysis
Checked for NULL values across all critical columns:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.unioned_tables`
WHERE 
  dwelling_type   IS NULL
  OR region       IS NULL
  OR area_suburb  IS NULL
  OR quarter_date IS NULL
  OR count        IS NULL
  OR median       IS NULL
ORDER BY quarter_date;
```

  dwelling_type,
  ROUND(AVG(avg_rent), 2) as avg_rent_2023,
  SUM(total_bonds) as total_yearly_bonds,

## 7. Key Insights and Findings

### 7.1 Property Type Dynamics
Four-bedroom houses showed the highest median rent prices across all dwelling types in 2023, followed by three-bedroom houses. This suggests a strong market preference for larger family homes, particularly in established suburbs.

### 7.2 Regional Growth Patterns
The data reveals significant regional disparities in rental price growth between 2002 and 2023:
- Inner Melbourne suburbs experienced the highest absolute price increases
- Regional areas showed the highest percentage growth, particularly in areas like Moe-Newborough and Sale-Maffra
- Coastal regions demonstrated strong consistent growth, especially in areas like Torquay and Ocean Grove

### 7.3 Market Supply Trends
Analysis of bond registrations reveals:
- A significant shift in rental property distribution from inner city to outer suburbs
- Increased supply in growth corridors, particularly in the western and southeastern regions
- Higher turnover rates in areas with predominantly smaller dwellings

### 7.4 Affordability Patterns
The research identified several key affordability trends:
- Persistent price gaps between inner and outer suburban areas
- Emerging affordable rental markets in regional centres
- Growing premium rental market in bayside suburbs

### 7.5 Market Volatility
Price volatility analysis shows:
- Higher price fluctuations in premium suburbs
- More stable pricing in established middle-ring suburbs
- Seasonal variations affecting different property types differently, with larger properties showing more stability

### 7.6 Structural Market Changes
The data points to several structural changes in Victoria's rental market:
- Increasing professionalisation of property management in growth corridors
- Shifting tenant preferences towards larger properties post-2020
- Growing importance of regional centres as rental markets
