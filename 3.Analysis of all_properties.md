# Analysis of `all_properties` Table

## 1. Data Quality and Integrity

### 1.1 Identify Duplicate Rows in the `all_properties` Table
```sql
SELECT 
    dwelling_type, 
    region, 
    area_suburb, 
    quarter, 
    count, 
    median, 
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties`
GROUP BY dwelling_type, region, area_suburb, quarter, count, median
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Result:** No duplicate values.

---

## 2. Detect Missing or Anomalous Data

### 2.1 Find Rows with Missing (NULL) Values
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties`
WHERE dwelling_type IS NULL
   OR region IS NULL
   OR area_suburb IS NULL
   OR quarter IS NULL
   OR count IS NULL
   OR median IS NULL;
```

**Result:** There are missing values linked to the inner_melbourne region in the suburb of Docklands. I will exclude the timeframe between quarter Mar 2000 and Dec 2001 from the analysis.

### 2.2 Find Rows with Anomalous Numeric Values
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties`
WHERE count < 0
   OR median < 0;
```

**Result:** No anomalous numeric values.

### 2.3 Find Rows with Anomalous String Values
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties`
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM UNNEST([dwelling_type, region, area_suburb]) AS col
  WHERE col LIKE 'median' OR col LIKE 'count'
);
```

**Result:** No anomalous string values.

## 3. Create a New Table Excluding Data for Specific Years

Create a new table that excludes data for the years 2000, 2001 and 2024, which either contain rows with null values or there is no data for the whole year.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties_report` AS
WITH parsed_data AS (
  SELECT
    dwelling_type,
    region,
    area_suburb,
    quarter,
    count,
    median,
    SAFE.PARSE_DATE('%b %Y', quarter) AS quarter_date
  FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties`
  WHERE median IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  dwelling_type,
  region,
  area_suburb,
  quarter,
  count,
  median
FROM parsed_data
WHERE quarter_date IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM quarter_date) BETWEEN 2002 AND 2023
ORDER BY quarter_date;
```

#### Create a View for Reference in Multiple Queries
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.avg_rent_by_year`  AS
SELECT
  region,
  area_suburb,
  AVG(CASE WHEN CAST(SUBSTR(quarter, -4) AS INT) = 2002 THEN median END) AS year_2002_avg_rent,
  AVG(CASE WHEN CAST(SUBSTR(quarter, -4) AS INT) = 2023 THEN median END) AS year_2023_avg_rent
FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties_report`
GROUP BY region, area_suburb;
```

## 5. Supply and Demand Relationship

### 5.1 Explore Number of Listings in 2002 Compared to Median Rent Price

```sql
WITH aggregated_listings AS (
  SELECT
    area_suburb,
    SUM(`count`) AS total_listing_count,
    AVG(median) AS avg_median_rent_price
  FROM `snappy-elf-359008.victoria_moving_rent_prices.all_properties_report`
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PARSE_DATE('%b %Y', quarter)) = 2002
  GROUP BY area_suburb
)

  total_listing_count,
  avg_median_rent_price,
FROM aggregated_listings
ORDER BY total_listing_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result:** CBD-St Kilda Rd, St. Kilda, South Yarra, Frankston, and Richmond-Burnley were the suburbs with the most number of listings in 2002.

### 5.2 Rank Areas/Suburbs by Total Listings Compared to Their Median Rent Ranking (2002)

## 6. Findings

### 6.1 Regional Variations in Median Rent Prices Over Time

In 2002, Port Melbourne recorded the highest average median rent while Moe-Newborough was at the lowest end. By 2023, the trend shifted—with Brighton East emerging as the area with the highest average median rent, whereas Moe-Newborough continued to have the lowest, indicating persistent low-rent trends in that suburb.

### 6.2 Diverse Rent Growth Patterns

Analysing changes from 2002 to 2023 reveals that Brighton East experienced the largest absolute increase in median rent. Additionally, when considering percentage growth, areas such as Moe-Newborough, Sale-Maffra, Dromana-Port Sea, Torquay, and Morwell registered the highest increases, pointing to significant relative shifts even if their absolute values remain modest.

### 6.3 Complex Supply and Demand Dynamics

In 2002, suburbs like CBD-St Kilda Rd, St Kilda, South Yarra, Frankston, and Richmond-Burnley had the highest listing counts. However, their ranking in median rent did not always align with their listing volumes—evidenced by CBD-St Kilda Rd ranking high in listings yet only mid-range in rent prices. A similar pattern is observed for 2023, suggesting that a high volume of listings does not directly translate to higher rents. This may reflect demographic and housing development growth towards the fringes of Melbourne's metropolitan area, and a shift in demand for seaside and regional Victoria housing. Further analysis is needed to examine the relationship between the number of listings, dwelling type, and median rent price.
